            Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a beautiful
            young girl named Cinderella. She lived with her cruel stepmother and
            stepsisters who treated her very badly. Cinderella was made to do
            all the chores around the house and was often very sad.

            One day, the king announced that he would be throwing a grand ball
            at the palace, and all the eligible young ladies in the land were
            invited to attend. Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters were very
            excited to attend the ball and spent all their time preparing for
            it.

          <p class="card-text">
            However, Cinderella was not allowed to attend the ball and was left
            behind to do more chores. She was very sad, but she still wished
            that she could go to the ball and dance with the prince.
